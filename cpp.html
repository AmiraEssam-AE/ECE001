    <p>C has been the parent language of a handful; some are either derived from C or inspired by its syntax,<br> constructs, and paradigms, including Java, Objective-C, and C#.<br> Even nowadays it is seen that C remains the most popular choice whenever there is a need to build high-performance applications.<br> C++ sees more performance than dynamically typed languages because the code is checked by type before it is executed for real reasons. <br>Technology key areas are Virtual Reality, Gaming, Computer Graphics etc.</p>
