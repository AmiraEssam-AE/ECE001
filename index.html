    <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
    <p>"Before 1954 almost all programming was done in assembly language. Modern structured programming languages first appeared in the computers of the 1950s and 60s.<br> The initial modern programming languages FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, and COBOL became the basis of the computing world in the middle of the 20th century,<br> and many variations of these languages spawned a multitude of new languages. Modified versions or FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL and COBOL are still used in 21st century machines. <br>As computers became more efficient and accessible to the public,<br> programming languages were forced to match the increasing complexities associated with the vast increase of technology until the early 1970s.<br>
A programming language can be described as a notational system in machine-readable and human-readable form to describe computation. <br>In simpler words, it is notation to express what you want it to do to a computer. While humans and machines can express via programming languages, there are limitations.<br> Programming languages, unlike human natural languages, can only facilitate communication of algorithmic ideas, and can not easily express or understand human emotion.<br> Machines read the program, and do what they told, if they understand what is presented. Humans have been discovering more complicated ways of interacting with their computer since the invention of the first complex machines to use more effective methods to achieve their goals.
The Internet boom of the 1990s gave birth to many of the languages commonly used by programmers. <br>Scripting languages such as Applescript, Javascript, and Python were born in this era, and paved the way for many other programming languages used for the virtual world of the web.<br> Programming languages are constantly being created, updated, and used. There are currently tens of thousands of programming languages in the world. This is not surprising, because of our dependence on technology and accessibility of powerful computers, designers have free reign to create any language they deem fit to solve any problem.<br> Languages can be created for various reasons ranging from the calculation of a corporation's salaries to the calculation of college student grades.</p><br>
